Canteen

One canteen near the instructional zone, another near the hostels and one Nescafe coffee shop provides refreshments to the students and the staff during and beyond the working hours.

Our canteen has a cordial and friendly atmosphere and the authorities see to it that the best possible nutritious and hygienic food services are being offered. Considering the infancy of the canteen, a number of infrastructural improvements in the existing facilities are being consistently addressed.
