Wildbeats, the cultural club of IIIT Kottayam, is one of the most celebrated clubs among the students of IIIT Kottayam. With the clear aim of promoting the importance of cultural activities among the students, it organizes the celebration of festivals that are native to multiple parts of India in the most splendid ways possible. Through the medium of these celebrations, the club aims to bestow upon the students, exposure to the idiosyncrasies of different cultures. This in turn helps the students remain connected to the rich cultural heritage that our country boasts of.

Wildbeats conducted its first Annual Cultural Fest ‘Enlace’ with immense support from both the students and the management, and it was a tremendous success. The confluence of creativity and cultures was a breathtaking sight to observe. Apart from the participation in a plethora of activities, students also got first-hand experience of event-management, and they also got enough creative space to explore the cultural avenues in unconventional ways. Needless to say, the ‘Wildbeats’ is paramount to the existence of IIIT Kottayam and its student life, and it will continue to sing the melody that its name signifies.
