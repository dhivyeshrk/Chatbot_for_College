# Chatbot for University 
A customizable chatbot made with Streamlit, LangChain, and ChromaDB. Adding knowledge is as simple as uploading text files with information. The entirety of the codebase was written on 7th September 2023 at the IEEE CIS AI Hackathon '23 Finale, so please bear with the code quality. Any contributions towards improving code quality are highly appreciated. 
## Run

##### Update knowledge base
Navigate to chatWithDocument/admin_side.py and type 'streamlit run admin_side.py' in the command line. Now you can upload any files that contain knowledge for your chatbot.
